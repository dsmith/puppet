 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Sep 2007 15:06:11 +1000

puppet (0.23.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recycle the HTTP connection if we get an EPIPE during a request.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Sep 2007 09:55:34 +1000

puppet (0.23.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

    release.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Sep 2007 07:45:07 +1000

puppet (0.23.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore ENOENT errors in the module plugin syncing code, since they're
    innocuous and expected.
  * Allow facts that are downloaded through pluginsync to be used like any
    other fact.
  * Allow users to still have an old-style plugins mount if they want, by
    specifying a path for the mount.  Also track down a fault in old-style
    fileserving which did strange slash-stripping.  Closes: #443932.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Sep 2007 16:41:32 +1000

puppet (0.23.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch rails/param_name.rb to stop query failures, as per puppet#784.
  * Actually honour namevar.
  * Only set dbuser if explicitly asked for.
  * Fix annoying database deletion error for ParamValue objects.
  * Add an accessor for ca_file, since older openssl-ruby only had a writer.
  * Fix the fileserver to honour ignore.  Thanks to Nathan Ward for the
    bug report on IRC.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Sep 2007 16:10:41 +1000

puppet (0.23.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add some NEWS for the ssldir transition.  Should have done that earlier.
  * Remove the explicit mode change for vardir, and fix up the mode on
    statedir, as well.  Closes: #425496.
  * Only set some database parameters if they're explicitly set; this makes
    life easier for PgSQL ident auth.
  * Allow empty config options.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Sep 2007 11:09:59 +1000

puppet (0.23.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix puppet#776 in a slightly better way by only flushing the cache when
    a value is changed, rather than whenever a value is read.
  * Apply patch from puppet#755 to cache connections to the Puppetmaster,
    which improves performance by more than a little.
  * Modify the fileserver so that it provides a 'plugins' mount which
    exports the union of the plugins directory of all modules.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Fri, 31 Aug 2007 15:32:04 +1000

puppet (0.23.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clear the config value cache every time.  This is a titchy little
    performance hit, but it works around puppet#776 rather nicely.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Aug 2007 16:08:04 +1000

puppet (0.23.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the SSL state directory to a more policy-friendly location,
    /var/lib/puppet/ssl.

puppet (0.23.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Switch primary maintainer to me.  Thanks jaq.
  * Make the recommendation for rails >= 1.2.3-2, to avoid
    incompatibilities.  This breaks compatibility with stable, but the rails
    package from unstable should install cleanly in stable.  Closes: #433999

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jul 2007 16:34:36 +1000

puppet (0.23.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

puppet (0.22.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Closes: #415773.
  * Switch to using our own logrotate config, and enhance it as per
    David Schmitt's suggestions.  Closes: #414282.
  * Add puppetrun to the puppetmaster package, and actually put puppetdoc
    into the puppet package.  Closes: #419273.
  * Copy vim syntax highlighting file into the puppet package, and add a
    stanza to have Vim automatically highlight .pp files.  Closes: #412868.
    Thanks to David Schmitt for researching how to do all of that.
  * Add a templatedir setting to the default puppetmasterd.conf to make it
    obvious that it can be changed.  Closes: #407506.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Apr 2007 14:03:33 +1000

puppet (0.22.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Feb 2007 09:06:46 +1100

puppet (0.22.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Use --startas instead of --init in init scripts, which (according to
    Paul Hampson) makes checking for already-running instances work.
    Closes: #405912.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Jan 2007 08:41:35 +1100
