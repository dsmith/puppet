puppet (0.25.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The default location of the puppet template directory has been moved to
  /etc/puppet/templates from /var/lib/puppet/templates.
  
  If you use templates in your manifests, please either set "templatedir" in
  /etc/puppet/puppet.conf to the old location, or move your templates to the new
  location.
